<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Ronan Cowper my student number is 3925551 and my student email is s3925551@student.rmit.edu.au.</p> I was born in Mackay Queensland then moved to Ayr Queensland when i was fairly young and have lived here for most of my life, I now rent a place in Ayr with my brother while I'm working casually doing uni and he is working fulltime at a sugar mill.</p>

<p>My dad David Cowper was born in England and moved to Australia with his dad when he was 10 years old. He lived in Sydney for most of his life before moving to Brisbane then as he got older he moved to Mackay and met my mother. My mum Rachelle Cowper was born in Mackay but lived most of her life in Cloncurry because my grandad worked as a train driver.</p>

<p> I completed high school at Ayr State High School, I did not obtain an OP because I was interested in getting a trade qualification rather than going to university. Well I graduated and got a job as a labourer with a chance for an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner at a engineering workshop in Ayr. I worked there for 3 months and realised that a trade wasn't for me,i quit the job and started working at a fuel service station thinking that it would only be temporary until I find a better job but living in a small rural town there weren't many jobs going around. I'm still at the fuel station 3 years later but a few weeks ago finally decided to turn my life around and start a uni degree which looking back now was probably the best decision I have ever made. Growing up in a rural town the only thing to do was play sports, every year I would change to a different sport starting with bowling then tennis, cricket and touch footy but i finally found my favourite sport rugby league when I started grade 9 at highschool, I played rugby league from 14 until now having made so many mates playing it.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>My interest in IT sparked when I was young as my dad, older step brother and aunty are all interested in IT. My dad loves computers and built his own when I was younger and always would let me play his computer with him and help me with my computer problems.</p>

<p>My step brother and aunty are both into IT my brother is currently working at a government building in brisbane working as an IT analyst and does some IT security and my aunty also has a job in IT but i don't see them often as they live pretty far away.</p>

<p>I started IT because of what they have showed me and my dad actually suggested RMIT to try it out and explore IT as it runs in my family and I hope to get into a job in IT once I get further into my studies and learn more about the different aspects and careers it provides.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/53944654?type=standout#searchRequestToken=6f2aae02-4fd3-42ca-9dd5-1cedc8258e5e</p>

<p>I have researched a few different careers that I could pursue in It and one that caught my eye would be network engineer. From my research a network engineer delivers network infrastructure to continue information activities refrenced in the link above, "Network engineers design and implement network configurations, troubleshoot performance issues, carry out network monitoring and configure security systems such as firewalls.". This position is appealing to me because my step brother has some experience in network security and has some me a couple of projects he has been on and I have found it interesting in many ways. An associate level degree is required to obtain an entry level network engineering career but some may require a bachelors degree in computer science, some other things a network engineer would need include good leadership and communication skills and the ability to problem solve.</p>

<h4>Personal Profile</h4>
<p>According to the three personality tests i completed I am more of a visual learner which I agree with strongly as I believed before that I learn best when showed how to complete tasks. I think I work well in a team but I also enjoy working by myself more because I am more of an introvert but also enjoy spending time with people, these tests have shown me that I personally would rather work by myself but I can work in a team if available and I usually get along with other people.</p>
